# Filters

## Overview

Both scopes have the capability for fluorescent imaging. The filter cube system in the low-mag scope provides flexibility, allowing for easy alternation of emission filters, dichroic mirrors between the cameras,
and the light source illuminating the sample. As the two scopes are aligned, laser lines can be employed to illuminate the sample during imaging with the low-magnification scope.

In contrast, the filters designated for the two imaging channels of the confocal spinning disk are integrated within the Dragonfly 200 Series. Each channel has a filter wheel that can accommodate up to 8 filters.
As of this report's publication, each wheel is equipped with three filters: one dual-band filter and two single-band filters. A critical aspect in filter selection is ensuring they block the four laser lines and
the LED on the low-magnification objective. The current filter choices are optimized for imaging BFP, GCaMP, CyOFP, mNeptune, tagRFP, and other fluorescent proteins with a comparable profile. It's crucial to emphasize
that altering these filters necessitates proper training on the Dragonfly system; otherwise, there's a risk of misalignment or damage.
