# Techincal Drawings
The technical drawings for the system can be found at [https://github.com/venkatachalamlab/large-files](https://github.com/venkatachalamlab/large-files) 
(This is a private repository and required access granted by Prof. Venkatachalam). I utilized SolidWorks for designing custom components, verifying part compatibility, 
and determining the dimensions of the custom parts. The repository contains three categories of files:

1. SolidWorks drawings of third-party components, such as those purchased from Thorlabs. 
2. SolidWorks drawings of items bought from third-party vendors who did not supply technical drawings. For these, I used SolidWorks to create the drawings
based on details from their manuals. Examples include the 4f optical extension and the Dragonfly 200 Series confocal spinning disk from Andor Technologies, and the objective lenses. 
3. Custom components that I designed. These were either fabricated at the Physics Department's machine shop at Northeastern University, such as those for the
motorized stage, or by external vendors like the daughter optical table used to mount the confocal spinning disk.
