## Overview

Our system incorporates an integrated laser engine, ILE 400 by Andor Technology, that offers four prevalent laser lines used in fluorescent imaging: 405nm, 488nm, 561nm, and 640nm.
This ILE's operation can be managed through the software development kit supplied by Andor Technologies. Moreover, a combination of TTL and analog signals can regulate each laser 
line's output power and toggle it on or off. A decisive factor in our choice of this ILE was Andor Technology's incorporation of Borealis illumination technology. 
This technology enhances uniformity, thereby expanding the usable field of view for imaging without necessitating adjustments to the laser power. 
Additionally, the system is equipped with a neutral filter, allowing for a reduction of the output power to one-tenth of the set power when necessary.
